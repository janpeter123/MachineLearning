# MachineLearning


## Welcome to my Machine Learning Repo.
Here you will find everything I did on a Machine Learning Course that I attended.
Artificial Intelligence was indeed one of my college's subject, but this one was not part of it.

The Couse had focus on Python and R, but I preferred to write only a repo with Python because it's a language that I have more experience.

#### ⚠️ Tip: You can see every notebook without needing to download it. Just Click on the notebook you want to visualize and you'll be able to see it without downloading.
